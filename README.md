### Stack
**this is my 3rd assignment in my data structures class.**
- Create a stack with the number to be retrieved from the user.
+ Method 1: Subtract any desired number from the stack to be created. (So ​​your pop method takes the element to be removed from the stack as a parameter and that element is removed from the stack.)
* Method 2: Swap the first element and the last element in the stack.
